 * @notice Adapted from OpenZeppelin's Time library: v5.0.0 for solc 0.8.19
 * @dev This library provides helpers for manipulating time-related objects.

 * It uses the following types:
 * - `uint48` for timepoints
 * - `uint32` for durations
 *
 * While the library doesn't provide specific types for timepoints and duration, it does provide:
 * - a `Delay` type to represent duration that can be programmed to change value automatically at a given point
 * - additional helper functions
